# Inception-V3

Introduction
This project contains the code for the Kaggel Pneumonia Detection Challenge. 

Briefly, my solution is based on an Keras implementation of Inception V3 which is a widely-used image recognition model that has been shown to attain greater than 78.1% accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. We made some improvements to the original code, and the results are ok.

Will aatacke this project at a later stage to se what improvements can be made.
